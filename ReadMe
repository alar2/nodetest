Initial nodeJS MongoDB test following 
http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/

This repo does not include the required node modules that should be included
under node_modules/
express
jade
mongodb
monk

It looks like an advantage of installing mongodb locally (per project) is not having to set dbpath in the command line. 
See also /etc/mongodb.conf

I had a global install of express as well: npm install -g express
but there were problems fixed with a local install. So it goes.

The only other note I want to add right now is this install is on Fedora 18 and no I did not end up using the yum repo:
yum erase mongo-10gen mongo-10gen-server

"While some of these distributions include their own MongoDB packages, the official MongoDB packages are generally more up to date."
